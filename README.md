## About AlgoVerse

AlgoVerse is an open-source community-driven project aimed at solving coding challenges from popular platforms like LeetCode, CodeForces, CodeChef, and more. This Hacktoberfest, we invite developers from around the world to join us in our coding adventure.

## How to Contribute

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

Start by forking this repository to your own GitHub account. You'll need it to make your contributions.

### Step 2: Solve a Challenge

Choose a coding challenge from your preferred platform (e.g., LeetCode, CodeForces, CodeChef) and write a solution in your favorite programming language. Follow our naming convention:

`<question_number>_<question_name>.<file_extension>`

For example: `1_hello_world.cpp`

If the question does not have any question number, name it as:

`<question_name>.<file_extension>`

Save the file in the <b>platform specific</b> folder.

For example: You are solving a coding challenge from LeetCode, save the file into the `LeetCode` folder.

If the folder for your platform does not exists, create a new folder and rename it according to your platform and add your files.

### Step 3: Add Comments

Inside your code file, add the URL of the question as a comment at the top. Additionally, provide a clear explanation of your approach using block comments. Don't forget to mention the time and space complexity.

```cpp
/*
Question URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/hello-world/
Approach:
1. Start by...
2. Then, we...
3. Finally, ...
Time Complexity: O(1)
Space Complexity: O(1)
*/
// Your code goes here
```

### Step 4: Commit and Push

Commit your code with a meaningful commit message, like "Solved Hello World" and push it to your forked repository.

### Step 5: Make a Pull Request

Create a Pull Request (PR) to our main repository with a detailed description of your contribution. Follow this format for your PR title:

```
[Platform] Challenge Name - Your GitHub Username
```

For example:

```
[LeetCode] Hello World - johndoe
```

### Step 6: Celebrate!

Sit back, relax, and wait for your PR to be reviewed and merged. Congratulations, you've contributed to AlgoVerse's Hacktoberfest celebration!

## How to Contribute Optimized Code
### Follow these steps to contribute to any existing solution by optimizing them:

* <b>Identify Opportunities</b>: Review the existing code to identify opportunities for optimization. This can include improving time complexity, reducing memory usage, or enhancing code readability.

* <b>Comment out existing code</b>: Comment out the existing code that you plan to optimize and place it at the bottom of the code file. This preserves the original implementation for reference.

* <b>Add new logic</b>: At the top of the code file, write your new, optimized code. Ensure that your code is well-documented and follows our coding standards and guidelines mentioned above.

After completing, your file structure must look like this.

```cpp
/*
Question URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/hello-world/

New Approach:
1. Start by...
2. Then, we...
3. Finally, ...
Time Complexity: O(1)
Space Complexity: O(1)
*/
// Your optimized code goes here

/*
Old Approach:
1. Start by...
2. Then, we...
3. Finally, ...
Time Complexity: O(1)
Space Complexity: O(1)

// Existing code goes here (Within block comments)
*/
```

* <b>Commit and submit a pull request</b>: Commit your code with a meaningful message and submit a pull request (PR) with your optimized code. Follow the PR guidelines mentioned above. Now sit back and relax and wait for your PR to be reviewed and merged.
